Software Engineering (Platforms Team),"Intermediate
Senior",Western Canada,Burnaby,British Columbia,"The Job
Software engineers at Arista deliver product features. The core responsibility is writing the code that drives our products. A software engineer is more than just a coding machine; they drive the whole development process including
- Deciding the features to build
- Driving the design
- Writing the code (duh!) and testing
- Documenting the feature
- Supporting customers in the field

Along the way, you might
- Extend and improve the test infrastructure
- Hack on our engineering tools, including p4, django, python, rpm, ...
- Work with sales and business development

Example Projects
We don't have time for busy work: every project that we do has customers clamoring for it. Along with quick release cycles and an engineer-oriented culture means we always have a slew of interesting projects to tackle. What project you'll work on at Arista will vary a lot depending on our customer demands and your interests. Here are some sample potential projects:

1) Latency Based Routing (Networking Protocol)

Our switches run routing protocols that program the hardware with the nexthop for forwarding packets. The nexthop determination is based on some metric of proximity or cost to the destination. For example, the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol relies on the Dijkstra's algorithm to minimize the number of hops to reach a destination.

With Latency Based Routing, the preferred path to a destination has the lowest aggregate delay across several hops. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the protocol converges fast on network events and stable to avoid constant changes in the preferred path. This feature is important for latency sensitive applications run by, for example, financial customers who connect to stock exchanges in multiple locations (New York, Chicago, Tokyo) and demand the lowest delays for receiving market information.

2) Redefining Load Balancing for Future Applications (Networking Protocol)

The Internet is glued together by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) has been the backbone of resilient network topologies by allowing multiple paths to a destination. With ECMP, the failure of a few links have little impact as the traffic transitions to the remaining links.
Customers are now demanding link bandwidth aware traffic load balancing through the Unequal Cost Multi Path (UCMP) extension to BGP which is cutting-edge technology on track to become an RFC standard. The project involves adding ability to match and set/tweak bandwidth advertisements in the BGP policy engine to allow UCMP formation.

3) Shared Strings (Software Infrastructure)

Arista is always concerned about memory efficiency as our switches don't have hard drives, and thus cannot page memory to disk. This means that when you run out of memory, you are hosed. And, as we add more features, we consume more memory. One way we could possibly reduce memory is shared strings. This would be a table per process that contains all unique strings instantiated. Whenever you go to instantiate a new string this table would be checked to see if that string already exists and if so, return a pointer to it. This table would have to be very efficient both in speed and size. Another benefit of this approach is that string comparisons could be very fast: O(1) address comparisons instead of O(length of string) character comparisons.

4) Programmable Operating System on a Switch (Software Defined Networks)

EOS SDK: Arista's EOS operating system is the first truly extensible network operating system on top of Linux. In addition to the standard Linux APIs, the SDK provides a set of higher-level APIs to enable third party developers to write their agents that run in EOS. It's a set of stable, versioned APIs published on GitHub, available both in C++ and Python. Our largest cloud customers leverage EOS SDK to integrate their custom orchestration, automated-management, and provisioning systems with Arista switches.
A significant fraction of today's Internet traffic is delivered to you using custom SDN applications that the largest cloud companies such as Netflix or Facebook built using EOS SDK. Projects here involve significant contributions to the maturing EOS SDK by developing new APIs to configure EOS. Your changes will be on GitHub in our EosSdk repository!

5) Rethinking and Redesigning (The Go Revolution)

Arista has a large C++ and Python codebase. Over the past year we've been implementing a lot of building blocks in Go in order to make this language a third option in our tool box. This project gives you the chance to rethink in pretty fundamental ways how various key software components in EOS work under the hood as Go enables us to easily explore alternate development and concurrency models. Come join the Go revolution at Arista.

6) In-service FPGA Upgrade of Modular Components (Talking to Hardware)

Arista's modular systems have hot swappable components which are inserted or removed on run-time with little performance impact to the system. Such components have FPGAs that are programmed by the hardware team and we would like the ability to easily and reliably upgrade the FPGA image on our products in the field with latest enhancements. This project will give you a chance to get really close to hardware and understand how the system initializes itself.

7) VMTracer ACLs (Cloud Datacenter)

Arista is dedicated to supporting datacenter deployments of our customers. Our integration with a VMWare server keeps the switch informed of the MAC addresses of different virtual machines. The switch monitors the traffic to locate and detect migrations of virtual machines. With this VMTracer capability, an EOS switch can keep specified virtual machines in the same virtual LAN (VLAN) segment.
The VMTracer ACLs project provides the ability to seamlessly migrate Access Control List configuration for virtual machines when they migrate. A simple access control list, for example, allows traffic on port 80 for web-server virtual machines or on port 3306 for MySql virutal machines.

8) KernelNetworkInfo agent (Kernel related)

Initially we had a state machine to pull the interfaces/ip addresses/ARP state from the kernel. This state machine had to be instantiated for each VRF in a lot of agents. The state machine setup a netlink socket with the kernel (for each VRF) which created a lot of contention on a lock in the kernel because we had lots of agents that needed to be notified for each configuration change. To address this, the KernelNetworkInfo agent was created that is responsible for getting the kernel state and pushing it into user address space. This way we only have one netlink socket per VRF in KernelNetworkInfo and all the agents could use the same information to read/react on the kernel state. That helped drastically reduce the contention and solved a lot of issues that were caused by that such as processes getting blocked.
